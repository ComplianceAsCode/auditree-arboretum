# {{ test.title }} Report {{ now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}

This report displays differences in the compliance automation execution Python
package environment since the previous execution.

<details>
<summary>More details...</summary>

Any **package version changes**
are largely informational.  They _can_ be used to debug why things worked
previously but aren't working today.  The compliance automation framework execution
environment depends on other of Python libraries.  These libraries can have new
releases and it's not outside the realm of possibility that a new release of a
dependency could cause a problem.  This report provides information that helps to
guard against that.  This report also checks whether the versions of the
[auditree-arboretum](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/auditree-arboretum) and
the [auditree-framework](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/auditree-framework)
packages are the most recent versions available, as is the expected behavior.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Remediation...</summary>

As stated above package version changes are information but can be used as part
of the process of debugging why things worked previously but currently don't.
However, if either the `auditree-arboretum` or the `auditree-framework` are
flagged as a **latest version violation** then that needs to be explained.  It
is expected that the most recent versions of each of those packages are used
during fetcher and check execution.

## {{ warning }}
{% if warning == 'Latest Version Violation'-%}
Checks that ensure that the `auditree-arboretum` and `auditree-framework` packages
are up to date have uncovered issues.  These violations should be investigated
because the expectation is that both the `auditree-arboretum` and `auditree-framework`
packages are always current and up to date.
{% else -%}
These findings are largely informational.  They can be used to debug issues with
the execution environment.
