# Kubernetes library

The fetchers and checks contained within this `kubernetes` category folder are
common tests that can be configured and executed for the purpose of generating
compliance reports and notifications using the [auditree-framework][].  They
validate the configuration and ensure smooth execution of an auditree instance.
See [auditree-framework documentation][] for more details.

These tests are normally executed by a CI/CD system like
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) as part of another project that uses this
library package as a dependency.

## Usage as a library

See [usage][] for specifics on including this library as a dependency and how
to include the fetchers and checks from this library in your downstream project.
